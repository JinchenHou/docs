- Where can I find all the tokens supporeted by the Loopring protocol, and how can I get my ERC20 token listed on a Loopring DEX?
> We have a set of [dedicated documents](https://loopring.github.io/docs/deployment/) detailing the process of registering new ERC20 tokens with the Loopring Protocol, as well as adding new traiding pairs to Loopring's official Bootstrap relay cluster and its [Loopr wallex](https://loopring.io) and [Circulr DEX](https://lcirculr.loopring.io).

- What's the usage of LRC token?
> LRC will be used to pay wallex/DEX for order management and relayers as matching fee. Relayers pays fiat fee to their developers, cloud services, etc, and also have to pay Ether to Ethereum miners to include trade settlement transactions into blocks. In the future, LRC will also be used by the community to govern the protocol updates.
